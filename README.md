# Final-Project
Car Classification - Neural Networks


#### To run the program
1. go into terminal
2. enter: python main.py (train-rate) (img-scaling) (epoch-size) or python main.py 0.8 100 10
  
### The resuts
The results are going to be found in the results.csv file.

### The dataset
The dataset that is used is in the cars_train folder; it contains the images of different types of cars.

### The devkit
The devkit folder contains information of each image in the dataset such as
- the cropping dimensions of a car,
- the correct output class of each car,
- and the image file name.
